# Comsc200 Object Oriented Programming C++
This course provides detailed coverage of the concepts and syntax of the C++ Language. Coverage includes inheritance, overloaded operators, overloaded default operators, virtual functions, memory management, files, streams, templates, and exceptions. CSU, UC

# Homework 1 - Homework 6:

The Homework was provided functions such as to calculate area, perimeter, surface area, and volume of common 2D and 3D shapes. 
It will include SQUARE, RECTANGLE, CIRCLE, TRIANGLE, CUBE, BOX and CYLINDER.

# Homework 7: 

Used the C++ GUI to build functions such as to calculate area, perimeter, surface area, and volume of common 2D and 3D shapes.

# Homework 8:

A classic problem in mathematics is the linear programming problem of finding the shortest route through a network of interconnected points.
Applications include finding the shortest distance from one city to another, and finding the critical path in a project. Write Routes.1.cpp, to designand 
test a class that represents a leg of a route between two adjacent cities.

# Elevator Homework:

Basic Elevator Implementation by used C++ GUI.

Approach:

I created 5 part class(h.file, cpp.file): the elevator, the rider, the floor, the panel, the building, and the main part file.

The Result:

● Implemented the C++ GUI data structure and build the Elevator Simulation System. 
● Read, analyzed, and implemented people enter the elevator, or leave the elevator of the elevator move locus. 
● Successfully demonstrated the C++ GUI to build a complex image Simulation system
